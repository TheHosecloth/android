To make development faster, I made a run configuration named "Desktop" such that the application could execute on the desktop platform without having to create an Android Virtual Device for each test run. Now, when attempting to run the application on the Android platform, it deosn't work. I could not find out why this is the case, but I assure you that all functionality will work if you set up a Desktop run configuration. Screenshots showing how I set up said configuration can be found in the directory Runner/README/

To set up the run configuration:
	1. Click "Edit Configurations" in the dropdown menu as demonstrated in "Edit Config Dropdown.jpg"
	2. After pressing the '+' button in the top left corner of the Edit Configurations window, make a new Application configuration as demonstrated in "New Config Dropdown.jpg"
	3. Enter in the proper run configuration information as demonstrated in "Desktop Run Config.jpg"
	4. Select Desktop as your desired project run configuration as displayed in "Select Desktop Config.jpg"
	5. Run the project.
